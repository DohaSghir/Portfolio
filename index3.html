            This project consists of designing a multifunctional board dedicated to the kitchen, which will meet the different needs linked to this room. In fact, it is equipped with a gas and smoke detector which, if detected, triggers a lamp and a buzzer, the latter of which can be turned off using a button. It also includes a motion sensor to control the kitchen lighting. So, a graphics tablet will allow you to take notes, for example recipes, ingredients, etc. Finally, a timer will remind you of the tasks to be accomplished and can also be used to time the cooking of food. Concerning the power supply, the table will be mainly powered by solar energy, thanks to integrated solar panels. However, in case of lack of sufficient solar energy, the panel can connect directly to the house's electrical grid for operation.
